# Modal

Modals are dialogs for contextual information, tasks, or workflows that appear
over the user interface.

## Import

```js
import { Modal } from '@fabric-ds/react';
```

## Example

```jsx example
function Example() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const [left, setLeft] = React.useState(true);
  const [height, setHeight] = React.useState('68%');

  const toggleModal = () => setOpen(!open);

  return (
    <>
      <Button utility onClick={toggleModal}>
        Open modal
      </Button>

      <Modal
        left={left}
        right
        open={open}
        onDismiss={toggleModal}
        title="Hello title"
        footer={
          <Button primary onClick={toggleModal}>
            Confirm
          </Button>
        }
        style={{
          '--f-modal-max-height': height,
          '--f-modal-height': '100%',
        }}
      >
        <div className="space-x-8">
          <button
            onClick={() => setHeight(height === '68%' ? '100%' : '68%')}
            className="button button--utility button--small mb-32"
          >
            Modify height
          </button>
          <button
            onClick={() => setLeft(!left)}
            className="button button--utility button--small mb-32"
          >
            Toggle the back-button
          </button>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1 className="h4 mb-16">This is a title for the content area</h1>
          <p>
            Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough. Behold the bold soldier
            control the globe slowly, proceeds to blow, swinging swords like
            Shinobi. The game of chess, is like a swordfight, you must think
            first before you move. My beats travel like a vortex through your
            spine, to the top of your cerebral cortex. I smoke on the mic like
            smoking Joe Frazier, the hell raiser, raising hell with the flavor.
          </p>
          <p>
            I breaks it down to the bone gristle, Ill speaking Scud missile heat
            seeking, Johnny Blazing. Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain
            imperial before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial.
            Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics, graphic displays melt
            the steel like blacksmiths. Perpendicular to the square we stay in
            gold like Flair, escape from your dragon's lair in particular. Shame
            on you when you stepped through to The Ol Dirty Bastard straight
            from the Brooklyn Zoo. Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain
            imperial before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough. Handcuffed in the back of a
            bus, forty of us. Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap
            assassinator, rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger. My beats
            travel like a vortex through your spine, to the top of your cerebral
            cortex. Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough. Well I'm a sire, I
            set the microphone on fire, rap styles vary and carry like Mariah.
          </p>
        </div>
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Content

Fabric guidelines state the following:

- The cancel action should always be on the left, while the main action is to
  the right.

## Non dismissable modals

The `onDismiss` prop is optional. It can be dropped to create a modal that won't
respond to `esc` keypresses and/or clicking outside the modal.

```jsx example
function Example() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const [mustAgree, setMustAgree] = React.useState(false);
  const [hasAgreed, setHasAgreed] = React.useState(false);

  const toggleModal = () => {
    if (open && !hasAgreed) {
      setMustAgree(true);
      return;
    }
    setMustAgree(false);
    setOpen(!open);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <Button utility onClick={toggleModal}>
        Open modal
      </Button>

      <Modal
        open={open}
        onDismiss={hasAgreed ? toggleModal : undefined}
        title="Non dismissable"
        footer={
          <>
            {mustAgree && <p className="m-10">You must agree first!</p>}
            <Button primary onClick={toggleModal}>
              Save
            </Button>
          </>
        }
      >
        <p>To go further, you need to agree to these bogus terms</p>
        <Toggle
          type="checkbox"
          label="I agree"
          checked={hasAgreed}
          onChange={(state) => setHasAgreed(state)}
        />
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

Modal needs either `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to be accessible to screen
readers.

All dialogs must have a title. Titles appear in bold at the top of the dialog
and use a few words to convey the outcome of what will happen if a user
continues with an action. Use the property `title` for this.

### Customizing focus behavior

By default the first interactive element in the modal will be focused when the
modal opens. Use `initialFocusRef` to customize this behavior. For instance,
this can be used to focus a call to action button.

```jsx example
function Example() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const focusRef = React.useRef();

  const toggleModal = () => setOpen(!open);

  return (
    <>
      <Button utility onClick={toggleModal}>
        Open modal
      </Button>
      <Modal
        open={open}
        initialFocusRef={focusRef}
        title="Customized focus behavior"
        footer={
          <>
            <Button onClick={toggleModal} className="mr-12">
              Cancel
            </Button>
            <Button primary ref={focusRef} onClick={toggleModal}>
              Accept
            </Button>
          </>
        }
      >
        <p>The call to action button has inital focus.</p>
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
}
```
